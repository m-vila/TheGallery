## Introduction

The Gallery project consists of a static website representing an art gallery. It includes three main pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`. The `index.html` serves as the homepage, providing information about upcoming exhibitions, featured artwork, and opening hours. The `about.html` page provides insights into the background of the gallery and its founder. Lastly, the `contact.html` page allows visitors to get in touch with the gallery through a contact form and provides the gallery's location on a map.

## Usage

To view the website locally, simply open the respective HTML files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`) in a web browser. You can also deploy these files to a web server to make the website accessible online.

The project's file structure is organized as follows:
